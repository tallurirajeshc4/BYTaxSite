                    <p>Once all income, deductions, and credits are accounted for, the taxpayer will either owe taxes or receive a refund. Taxes are typically paid through withholding (W-2) or estimated tax payments (self-employed individuals). Refunds are issued when more taxes have been paid than owed.</p>
