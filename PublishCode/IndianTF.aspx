                        <p class="fs-5 text-primary mb-4">Individual tax filing is the process by which a person reports their income, expenses, deductions, and tax credits to the government, typically for the previous calendar year. In the U.S., individual tax returns are filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) using forms like the 1040. Here's an overview of the individual tax filing process:</p>
                        <b>Filing Deadline:</b>
                        <ul>
                            
                            <li>The typical deadline for individual tax filing is April 15 of each year, for the previous year's taxes.</li>
                            <li>If April 15 falls on a weekend or holiday, the deadline may be extended.</li>
                            <li>Extensions (e.g., Form 4868) can be filed to push the deadline to October 15, but taxes owed must still be paid by the April deadline.</li>
                           
                        </ul>
                        <b>Taxable Income:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>W-2 Income (from employment)</li>
                            <li>Investment Income (interest, dividends, and capital gains)</li>
                            <li>Business Income (if self-employed or running a small business)</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>Once all income, deductions, and credits are accounted for, the taxpayer will either owe taxes or receive a refund. Taxes are typically paid through withholding (W-2) or estimated tax payments (self-employed individuals). Refunds are issued when more taxes have been paid than owed.</p>
